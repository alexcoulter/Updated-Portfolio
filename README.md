# Bootstrap-Portfolio

### Description
* I created this online portfolio to show prospective employers who I am and what I have to offer
* This project involved me taking my [Original Portfolio](https://github.com/alexcoulter/my-portfolio) and updating it using Bootstrap and media queries to make it responsive
* With these improvements, my page's content scales up and down on different sized screens so it looks as good on a cell phone as it does on a desktop computer.

## Screen Sizes Supported
* large - `> 980px wide`
* medium - `769px - 980px wide`
* small - `641px - 768px wide`
* x-small - `<= 640px wide`

## Bootstrap Elements Used
* Navbar
* Responsive Containers
* Responsive Images
* Bootstrap's Grid System (rows, and columns, sub-rows, and sub-columns)
* Responsive floats based on screen size
